# SpanSight — Requirements Traceability Matrix

**RTM** · v1.0 · Date: 2026-07-17 · Status: For review · Companion to [REQUIREMENTS.md](./REQUIREMENTS.md) (single source of requirement text — this file carries links, not copies)

**Maintenance rule (SDLC.md §§3–4):** update the row when a PR closes or changes a requirement; audited at every phase gate — a phase cannot close with an orphan (no design/implementation) or unverified (no evidence) in-phase requirement.

**Status values:** Planned · In progress · In review · Done · Deferred · Withdrawn.

> **2026-07-17:** Weeks 2–4 implementation pass delivered (AI-USAGE v1.1), line-reviewed and merged to `main` as PRs #2/#3. **2026-07-18 (AI-USAGE v1.2):** statuses now move to *Done* when the implementing PR merges with green CI; Raziel's mastery is verified in the post-completion code study. Real 2025 snapshot loaded locally: 743,398 read · 741,131 loaded · 2,267 quarantined (0.30%), run #1.
